To implement a function we use the keyword `def` followed by a function name, brackets and the input arguments and a colon e.g. ` def func(arg1):`. This would create a function with the name `func` which takes one input argument `arg1`. Functions do not necessarily need input arguments if they are supposed to perform only hard-coded procedures. In the next lines we can define what that function should do. This function definition is all written with one indentation block.\n",
