        "1. init(self): Initializes an empty dictionary to store student grades.\n",
        "2. add_grade(self, student_id, grade): Adds a grade to the grade tracker for the given student. The student_id should be the key, and the grade should be the value in the dictionary. If the student_id already exists in the grade tracker, print a message indicating that the grade has been updated.\n",
        "3. remove_grade(self, student_id): Removes the grade for the given student from the grade tracker. If the student_id is found and removed, print a message indicating that the grade has been removed. If the student_id is not found in the grade tracker, print a message indicating that the student does not have a grade recorded.\n",
