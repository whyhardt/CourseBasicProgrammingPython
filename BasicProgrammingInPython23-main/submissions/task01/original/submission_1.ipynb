    "In order to pass this sheet you need to achieve 10/20 points.  \n",
    "For the best possible grade you require 20/20 points, however, since some harder tasks may take a lot of time you don't have to pressure yourself.  \n",
    "If you complete any three tasks on a sheet you will definitely get a good grade for that sheet.  \n",
    "Hand in your sheet in studip in the respective folder until the deadline.  \n",
    "If you receive no email until a few days after submission you will have passed, the sample solution will also be uploaded around then.  \n",
    "If you receive an email you don't need to worry, you can fail one sheet and also your total points will also be taken into account for the final pass or fail.  "
