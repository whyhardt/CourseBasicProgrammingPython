    "## Imports\n",
    "From now on you will encounter an import cell here in the top which you should **always** execute first to import necessary libraries for later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we want to provide you with a rundown of how imports work since it is related to classes and methods.  \n",
    "Imports always consist of either a full or a partial import, full imports are written like ```import library```, partial imports are written like ```from library import Class```.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of libraries as separate python scripts from which you import code written, if you say ```from myscript import ThisClass```, what you are essentially doing is run the ```ThisClass``` class definition part of the script ```myscript.py```.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Many libraries are built-in and do not require installing such as ```math```, ```re``` (regex), or ```time```.  \n",
    "Others, like ```numpy```, ```pandas```, or ```tensorflow```, require an installation via pip or another method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use ```as``` and ```,``` in your imports.  \n",
    "If you type ```import numpy as np``` for instance, then you do not have to type ```numpy.array```, but rather just ```np.array``` which can be a useful abbreviation or be used to rename something important if you have two functions with the same name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do ```from datetime import datetime, timedelta``` for example, you are selecting specifically the part ```datetime``` and ```timedelta``` only from the ```datetime``` library. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may even do something like ```from library import Function as anothername```.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this explanation helps you with formulating and understanding import statements.  "

    "## Task 1 - Creating a Student Class (6 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python class called ```Student``` which should take the following attributes: ```name```, ```age```, and ```grade```.\n",
    "After you define the class, implement the methods ```get_name()```, ```get_age()```, and ```get_grade()``` to access these attributes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to write the whole class from scratch here, then in the cell right below, create an instance of the class and name it ```student```.  \n",
    "Finally, you can execute the third code cell which is already pre-written code to retrieve the attributes of the class from your written getter-methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** You will need to define a ```__init__()``` method to be able to receive three arguments or a tuple which represents the three arguments.  \n",
    "Additionally, you will need three getter-methods which **return** the value of a certain attribute of the class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is more like a toy task honestly, in reality you would not use getters for simple attributes like this and you could also write a ```__repr__``` or a ```__str__``` method to make the instance print it's attributes, this is mainly for practice. ;)"
