    "Python is a high-level [blank1] language that is widely used for [blank2] purposes. It is known for its simplicity and readability. Python supports various programming [blank3], including [blank4], [blank5], and [blank6] programming paradigms. One of the key features of Python is its extensive [blank7] library ecosystem. Popular libraries such as [blank8] and [blank9] provide powerful tools for data analysis and manipulation. Another widely used library, [blank10], is commonly used for scientific computing and numerical operations. Python also has built-in support for [blank11] handling, allowing developers to efficiently process and manipulate textual data. Regular expressions are powerful tools for [blank12] patterns in strings and performing complex text processing operations. \n",
    "In addition to its flexibility, Python is known for its extensive [blank13] community. Developers can find a vast amount of resources, tutorials, and [blank14] to support their programming journey. The Python community is vibrant and constantly contributes to the growth and improvement of the language.\n",
