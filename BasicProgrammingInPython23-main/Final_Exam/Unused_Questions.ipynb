    "You are tasked with writing a Python program to store a list of strings into a text file. Each string in the list should be written on a new line in the text file. This task is commonly encountered in scenarios where you need to save data to a file for future reference or to share information in a readable format.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function should perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the specified file in write mode using the open() function.\n",
    "* Iterate over each string in the strings list.\n",
    "* Write each string to the file, followed by a newline character (\\n), using the file object's write() method.\n",
    "* Close the file using the close() method to ensure that all the data is saved.\n",
    "Your task is to implement the write_strings_to_file function and provide the code for it. Additionally, include any necessary imports that you may need.\n",
