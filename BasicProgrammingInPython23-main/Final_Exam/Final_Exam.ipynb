    "### **03.07.2023**\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time**\n",
    "**Start Time:** 12:00 (UTC+2/CEST)  \n",
    "**End Time:** 14:00 (UTC+2/CEST)  \n",
    "**Time:** 120 Minutes  \n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important information**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handing in and time\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 120 minutes to work on the exam in total, starting from 12:00 (UTC+2/CEST aka German time), as stated above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to finish on time, set yourself an alarm or listen for us telling you in the exam support meeting room before the end of the exam that you have only a few minutes left.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The exam officially ends at 16:00, you will be allowed to hand in your solutions using the exam submission folder, or, if you encounter problems, via e-mail to one of organizers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions later than 16:10 will not be accepted and if no submission was made till then, it will be counted as 0 points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The submissions format is that of a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) document, alternatively python scripts (.py) or a pdf file can be submitted, any other format will be counted as a fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit your exam in the folder \"Final Exam Submission\" on StudIP under the file section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working on the tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding your submission, make sure you follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not change any of the task description cells in this document.\n",
    "- Do not submit multiple alternative solutions to tasks, we will ignore all but the last solution if you do this.\n",
    "- Do not change the names of variables already defined and try to use the exact names for variables from the task description if given.\n",
    "- Read the task descriptions carefully to not miss explicit and clear instructions like, \"write a function that **returns a string**\"\" instead of \"write a function that **prints a string**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not adhere to these rules you may lose points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cheating and copying code\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any online resource to help you with the exam, however, you are not allowed to communicate to anyone and not allowed to copy from anyone and paste their code in your exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also counts for code from ChatGPT or code found on the internet, write your own code! \n",
    "\n",
    "For smaller parts like copying a simple \"```np.random.randint(1, 10, 100)```\" this should not be a problem unless copied from another student. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we can prove you communicated with another student or exchanged answers or copied large pieces of code, then your exam will be graded as 0 points and you fail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can test it and have tested it for the weekly assignments, but decided to not act upon it for the weekly assignments to not reveal how we do it before the exam, so if you worked with someone and copied in the past, stop doing it for the exam or there might be consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are of similar difficulty as the weekly assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam contains 12 questions, so the content of about three weekly assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will grade all your submitted tasks but only give you the points of the eight highest valued tasks you worked on.\n",
    "For instance, if you worked on eight tasks which give five points and on two tasks which give six points, then we will ignore two tasks for five points and you will get 48 points. This way you can choose which tasks to work on based on difficulty and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "Total amount of points in the exam: 60  \n",
    "The maximum amount of points you can reach this way is: 44  \n",
    "The minimum amount of points you can reach this way is: 36  \n",
    "The number of points needed to pass the exam is: 28  \n",
    "Doing any combination of eight tasks will reach 28 points if you do not lose more than 8 points total over all of them, therefore we recommend working on nine tasks to complete the exam since we will pick your highest graded eight tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final words\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start working on this exam, make sure take a careful look over the entire exam before you decide to work on anything, to get an overview and already start thinking about which tasks to ignore and which tasks to spend more time on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck and we hope this exam will be fair and all of you will pass!\n",
